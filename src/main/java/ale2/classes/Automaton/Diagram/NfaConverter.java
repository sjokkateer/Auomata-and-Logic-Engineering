public class NfaConverter {
    // Class responsible for converting NFA to DFA.

    // A method that checks for epsilon transitions
    // and returns the set of all states that are reachable over epsilon transitions
    // thus when current state under investigation (s1) has empty transition to s2 and s2 empty to s3, we get s1, s2, s3
    // as the new state.
    // We can use the earlier created transition function for achieving this.
